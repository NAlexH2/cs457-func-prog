# Assignment3

In this assignment, you will be working on two files, namely `src/Lists.lhs` and
`src/Folds.lhs`. The `src/Lists.lhs` file asks you to implement some functions
without using any functions from `Prelude` or `Data.List`; the `src/Folds.lhs`
file is similar, but you are asked to use `map`, `foldr`, and/or `para` (a
function that is defined in the `src/Folds.lhs` file) to implement certain
functions (some of them are the same functions from `src/Lists.lhs`).

You should finish `src/Lists.lhs` first before starting `src/Folds.lhs`.

More detailed instructions can be found in these files.

For submission: You should use make all the files under the `src` directory into
a `zip` or `tar` package and submit the package on Canvas.
