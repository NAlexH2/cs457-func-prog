# Assignment4

In this assignment, you will be working on two files, namely `src/SortedList.hs`
and `src/MergeSort.hs`. Combined together, these two files implement a merge
sort algorithm by only using the `Monoid` and `Foldable` methods. 

You should finish `src/SortedList.hs` first before starting `src/MergeSort.hs`.

More detailed instructions can be found in these files.

For submission: You should use make all the files under the `src` directory into
a `zip` or `tar` package and submit the package on Canvas.
