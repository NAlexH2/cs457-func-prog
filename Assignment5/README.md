# Assignment5

In this assignment, you will be working on three files, namely
`src/MaybePractice.lhs`, `src/ListPractice.lhs`, and
`src/GenericMonadFunctions.lhs`. You can finish these files in any order as they
are independent from each other, but I recommend you finish both
`src/MaybePractice.lhs` and `src/ListPractice.lhs` before starting
`src/GenericMonadFunctions.lhs`.

More detailed instructions can be found in these files.

For submission: You should use make all the files under the `src` directory into
a `zip` or `tar` package and submit the package on Canvas.
