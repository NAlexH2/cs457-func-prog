# Assignment 6

In this assignment, you will be working on `src/Parser.lhs` file. You only need
to submit the `Parser.lhs` file for this assignment.

## How to compile your program

To compile your program, you just type the following command anywhere under the
project's directory:

```
stack build
```

If you have finished your homework, you might see a "parse error". This is
normal as one of the problems in the assignment does contain some syntax error
for you to fix.

Your code MUST successfully compile to get any points in this assignment.

## How to run your program

The assignment has already included a number of tests. To run these tests,
simply type the following command:

```
stack run Main
```

Alternatively:

```
stack run --
```

## How to run your program using GHCI

If you are having trouble loading your code using GHCI, try the following:

```
stack ghci
```

## Check style

You can also check the style of your program using hlint:

``` sh
hlint Main.lhs
```
